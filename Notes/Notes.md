"The emergency department is an environment with inherent risk due to high patient volumes, time pressure and limited information"
- What affect risk? => 
  1. High patient volumes 
  2. Time pressure
     - Time to admit , treat and discharge patient
     - Must be done quickly and accurately
- Limited info =>
  1. Limited information on patient as they may not speak English, may not have records, withhold info
  2. Limited info on problem. could be very rare. solutions to problems are with top doctors 


"This environment and the high patient turnover may increase the risk of mistakes and errors"
1. High patient turnover is the rapid rate at which patients enter and leave. makes it hard for doctors to track patient

"Institutional memory is the collective experience and knowledge of a department which often mitigates this risk is often diluted with time and staff turnover"
1. Institutional memory had knowledge of people in department (maybe not hospital or area etc.)
2. As many staff come in and leave, which is common in Emergency department, they take with them their experience which hasn't been recorded. new comers have no experience so they only experience and knowledge gained is with those that stay
3. Time => 
   - Maybe not enough time to ask around which is further emphasised by time pressure. the patient cant be kept waiting to look, the injury maybe very severe, so the rush to get the info is very intense.
   - To find a doctor who may not even be around or uncontactable is very long. this is also increased by environment

"It is beyond the individual and as such requires transmission of this experience and knowledge through ‘the institution’. The memory project aims to strengthen our institutional memory and communicate the lessons learnt in the emergency department at RLH. This may also serve as a platform for learning throughout the wider trust and the specialty as a whole"

- No one person can do it alone so a joint effort is required.
- Having a repository of information where a doctor can access is needed
- Must strengthen memory of doctors
