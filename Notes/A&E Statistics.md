Over the course of a year there are around 16 million attendances at major hospital A&E and 9 million at minor units. 

A&E attendances have increased over time. In the most recent quarter, attendances at major departments were 12% higher than they were ten years ago (+4,844 per day), while attendances at minor departments were 30% higher (+5,770 per day)

Most common measure of A&E waiting times is the “four-hour wait” – the percentage of patients whose total time in A&E is four hours or more (measured from arrival to departure, admission or transfer)

The current target is that 95% of attendances should last less than four hours.
